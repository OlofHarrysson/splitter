Have different options
- QR code
- Sound (good because sample rate is so high -> exact time)
- Hand signals / actions
  Dataset: https://20bn.com/datasets/jester
  95% accuracy on some of these actions
- Pure timestamp (from an app / input by hand if you dont want to use app)

QR-code
We don't care about much information - just want to be able to see it from afar.
There are different types. iQR seems to be better, https://www.qrcode.com/en/codes/iqr.html but haven't found a reader. Supports rectangle qr codes which fits a phone better

Better QR code
Can make each pixel bigger. Can encode a bit in a corner piece. Can make each pixel have 3 values (white, gray, black) or even more with RGB. Quickly becomes enough bits.

3x3 pixels -> 2^9=512
3x3 pixels -> 3^9=19683 (white, gray, black)
3x3 pixels -> 4^9=262144 (white, light-gray, dark-gray, black)
4x4 pixels -> 2^16=65536
4x4 pixels -> 3^16=43046721


QR-det-network
A network where the last layer does avg-pool in the depth layer to get a grid of probabilities for a found qr detections. Could do data like I did for my thesis.

App
If I do an app it offers up a few possibilities. I can create a project within the app and from there create complicated tags that wont fit in a QR code - but they will be mapped to simple ints which do fit in QR - hopefully even miiini QR. Once the project is finilized you can export the mapping to the python program - json or maybe through a big QR code that you scan with webcam-ish?

App should also have option of just saving tags, without putting them into a QR and sync to video.


Zbar
Want to try to see if I can find finder patterns even if I cant decode the bar

Final Cut Xml
Want to let users import media that comes with keywords. In xml you have to specify the video and its format, fps etc - what if users have other preference?
Would be better to let users import the media, select the files and export an xml - send that to my program which creates a new xml and they can import that

Final Cut / Premier Addon
Mark import folder and right click -> splitter organize -> brings up window with some settings. One cool feature would be to analyze images / sound / metadata to create automatic clips or tags along with the defined ones.

Pros & Cons QR code
Pro - Video doesn't need a timestamp. Good if no GPS / bad clock
Pro - Can print pre-defined QR codes to avoid using an app
Pro - Keeps information if video is re-encoded.

Con - Have to analyze images to find qr-code. Expensive, can miss them
Con - Easier to create event directly in an app with time than to create event and then link to video.


Pure post-processing options
Dictating speech seems very important but already has a few big players
Automatic tagging of video would be good. What tags to select?
Automatically detect scene-repeats (duplicates) would be useful. What about scenes which are similar but not duplicates? Could give a draft that can be edited
