TODO
handle sound files and not just video files.
Create new repo. Decide on name. Sticker, notes
Automatically use all files in xml-folder? Risk of rerunning old xmls
Find docs website
Could I sign up a new google cloud and get $300 credit. Then limit duration to, say 5 minutes and systemwide $10 a day so people can skip that step.
Could I possibly skip the git step, and just execute a docker container from the cloud? Pricing: $2.16/hour-channel
timestamped_files when uploading to cloud

Anfig note: prefer not to have the default setup with a string. Better to set it explicitly. Like register available ones



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Webpage
Features:
- Install guide with videos/gifs
  - Images to right. Can I skip the layout? Set up reusable code blocks
  - Create changed theme to load? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create youtube video.
- Record real video
  - Create transcript
- Screen record workflow
- Edit video together

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create forum post
Make install instructions
- Docker
- open terminal
- drag & drop folder to open that path
- git, build docker
- run program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Would also work for podcasts

Voice commands
Debug commands - https://speechlogger.appspot.com/
- Recording assistant. Video helper
- Start/end clip
- Add mark(s) *name*. Adds video

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long term
- Workflow Extension - plugin for final cut. Seems like you have to collaborate with apple? Mac OS desktop client could allow for drag and drop workflow at least.
- Add full transcriptions?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
App
If I do an app it offers up a few possibilities. I can create a project within the app and from there create complicated tags that wont fit in a QR code - but they will be mapped to simple ints which do fit in QR - hopefully even miiini QR. Once the project is finilized you can export the mapping to the python program - json or maybe through a big QR code that you scan with webcam-ish?

App should also have option of just saving tags, without putting them into a QR and sync to video.

Pure post-processing options
Dictating speech seems very important but already has a few big players
Automatic tagging of video would be good. What tags to select?
Automatically detect scene-repeats (duplicates) would be useful. What about scenes which are similar but not duplicates? Could give a draft that can be edited
