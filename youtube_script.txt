Video
1. Starts by me screaming "action!!!" and showing the QR code. Then a very short, funny/impactful scene happens. I yell CUT and show the stop.
2. Explain the system. Should do one more start-stop during this.
3. Show a screen capture on my computer of how the processing is done. Show final clips
